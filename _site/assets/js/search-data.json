    "title": "Webauthn Overview",
    "content": "Webauthn is a new standard for authenticating users on the web. It offers numerous benefits over traditional methods such as username/password, two-factor authentication, and biometrics. Several more robust authentication mechanisms such as certificates and hardware tokens have been supported for specific applications but are still unreliable for the end users. A website can store and retrieve federated credentials, public keys, and passwords using the Credential Management API. These features enable users to log in without entering their passwords, view the federated account they used to access the website, and continue a session without having to go through the explicit sign-in flow for an expired session. Strong authentication using asymmetric key cryptography is made possible via the Web Authentication API, an extension of the Credential Management API enabling passwordless authentication and secure second-factor authentication without SMS texts. Webauthn uses a Public Key stored in the server &amp; a Private key (provided by the end-user) to authenticate the user. It was officially recognized as a W3C web standard in March 2019. Today, WebAuthn is part of the FIDO Alliance’s FIDO2 specifications and the FIDO Alliance runs certification programs to ensure compliance. Passwordless authentication allows users to log in without the need of remembering a password. Instead of conventional username and password,WebAuthn allows you to use the login methods already set up on your device. So using Web Authentication, you would be able to use the fingerprint sensor on your phone, or Windows Hello on your PC, or you could even use your Apple ID to login into any website. The supported methods include but are not limited to: . | Windows Hello | Fingerprint Sensors on both Laptops/Mobiles | Windows PIN | Yubikey | Face Authentication | . ",
