# Authnull

Authnull is a flexible, one-shop-stop solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users.

We are an Identity Provider Platform that provides passwordless authentication for Web Apps utilising [WebAuthN](http://127.0.0.1:4000/help/docs/Intro/webauthn_overview/) / FIDO 2 standards along with Apple Passkeys out of the box.

The client is responsible for both marshalling the inputs for the underlying authenticator operations, and for returning the results of the latter operations to the Web Authentication API's callers. Authnull utilizes a FIDO2-compliant authentication method enabling the user to have a seamless & highly-secure authentication.
