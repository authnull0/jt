### **Question: I lost my registered authenticating device Phone, Yubikey, Laptop?**

**Answer:** 

* Contact your Authnull administrator immediately if you lose your phone or suspect that it's been stolen!
If your organization enabled Authnull's self-service feature and you had previously enrolled a second authentication device you can use Devices section in the settings to delete your lost or stolen phone.

* If you aren't able to log in to Authnull at all then your Authnull administrator can disable the missing phone for authentication and help you log in using another method.

* While it's important that you contact your administrator if you lose your phone, remember that your password will still protect your account.

### **Question: I am not receiving push notification in my mobile?**

**Answer:** 

1. Open the Authnull website and tap the Edit button in the top left of the people list screen, then tap the name of the person that isn't receiving push requests.

2. Next, tap the Get Started button in the "Missing Notifications?" section of the "Account Details" screen.
Authnull Mobile performs the test. If any step fails, you'll receive further troubleshooting suggestions. After taking the suggested actions, tap **Run test again* to retry.

3. The steps that Push Troubleshooting performs automatically are as follows:

* Check device settings.
* Check internet connectivity.
* Check that the device can contact Authnull's cloud service.
* Attempts to send a test Authnull Push notification.
